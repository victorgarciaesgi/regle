# Regle Contributing Guide

Before submitting your contribution, please make sure to take a moment and read through the following guide:

## Repo Setup

The Regle repo is a monorepo using pnpm workspaces. The package manager used to install and link dependencies must be [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/).

1. Run `npx corepack install` to install the correct package manager
2. Run `pnpm install`
3. Run `pnpm run build` to build all monorepo packages

Run `pnpm run dev` to have a watch mode for the builds.


### Independant builds

This project uses turborepo. So you can run any command using:

`pnpx turbo build --filter='@regle/core'`

### Playground

You can run a Vue 3 and Nuxt playground using:

-`pnpm run play:vue3` 
-`pnpm run play:nuxt`


### Unit Testing

1. Run
   - `pnpm run test:dev` to run runtime tests in watch mode
   - `pnpm run test:dts` to run all the typecheck tests
   - `pnpm run test` to run all the test suite
  
You can additionally run all TS related typechecking and type unit tests using:
  - `pnpm run typecheck`

### UI Testing

Ui testing uses playwright. You can run the tests using:

- `pnpm run ui-tests:run` to run the tests
   - `pnpm run ui-tests:run --headed` to run the server in headed mode
   - `pnpm run ui-tests:run --ui` to run the tests in ui mode
- `pnpm run ui-tests:test` to run the tests and generate a report


### Docs

1. Run `pnpm run docs:dev` to start the docs in dev mode
2. Run `pnpm run docs:build` to ensure docs build correctly, `twoslash` can fail if not done right
