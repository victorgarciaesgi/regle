# Announcing Regle `1.1` üéâ 

<br/>

![regle 1.1](/regle-1.1-article.png)

<br/>


I'm happy to announce that a new minor release of Regle is out, bringing exciting new features.

Regle has been on `1.0` for 1 month now and have reached
- **124** stars ‚≠êÔ∏è
- **100k npm downloads**

A big thanks to anyone using Regle in the early stages, helping me find and fix edge cases and add more useful features.

<ins>For those who are discovering this library with this blog post</ins>, Regle is a type safe and headless form validation library made for Vue.

It's entirely data-driven, allowing the validation logic to mirror your data structure, enabling a clear separation between the UI and validation logic.

I consider it the successor of **Vuelidate**.


## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Regle playground

A Regle online playground is now available at https://play.reglejs.dev !  
It provides the same features as the Vue playground while being focused on Regle.

It will make it easier to prototype or to report bugs.

## üîÉ Variants and discriminated unions support

Your form may not be linear, and have multiple fields that depends on a condition or a toggle.
It can be complex and become a mess when trying to organise your types around it.

Regle variants offer a way to simply declare and use this discriminated unions, while keeping all fields correctly types and also runtime safe.


```vue twoslash
<template>
    <div v-if="narrowVariant(r$.$fields, 'type', 'EMAIL')">
      <!-- `email` is a known field only in this block -->
      <input v-model="r$.$fields.email.$value" placeholder='Email'/>
      <Errors :errors="r$.$fields.email.$errors"/>
    </div>
    
    <div v-else-if="narrowVariant(r$.$fields, 'type', 'GITHUB')">
      <!-- `username` is a known field only in this block -->
      <input v-model="r$.$fields.username.$value" placeholder='Email'/>
      <Errors :errors="r$.$fields.username.$errors"/>
    </div>

</template>

<script setup lang='ts'>
import {ref} from 'vue';
import { literal, required, email } from '@regle/rules';
type FormStateLoginType = 
| {type: 'EMAIL', email: string} 
| {type: 'GITHUB', username: string} 
| {type?: undefined}

type FormState = {
  firstName?: string;
  lastName?: string;
} & FormStateLoginType

// ---cut---
import { useRegle, createVariant, narrowVariant } from '@regle/core';

const state = ref<FormState>({})

const {r$} = useRegle(state, () => {

  const variant = createVariant(state, 'type', [
    {type: { literal: literal('EMAIL')}, email: { required, email }},
    {type: { literal: literal('GITHUB')}, username: { required }},
    {type: { required }},
  ]);

  return {
    firstName: { required },
    ...variant.value,
  };
})

</script>
```

## ‚úÖ `InferSafeOutput` type to infer safe form values

Like Zod's `Infer` utility, Regle now provide its own shortcut for extracting safe output from any `r$` instance.

```ts twoslash
import { ref, type Ref, computed } from 'vue';
import { required } from '@regle/rules';
// ---cut---
import { useRegle, InferSafeOutput } from '@regle/core';

const { r$ } = useRegle({ firstName: '', lastName: '' }, {
  lastName: { required },
});

type FormRequest = InferSafeOutput<typeof r$>;
//    ^?


```

## ü¶∏ Support Zod 4 <span data-title="zod"></span> 

[Zod 4 is currently in beta](https://v4.zod.dev/v4), and Regle officially supports it.

Some bugs on Zod side may persists, but breaking changes are minimal.  
Nothing is to change on Regle side.

## üìû Allow rules with optional parameters to be used without function call

This is a thing that was bugging me for a while: *rules* that add an optional parameter still had to be used by a function call.

Ex: 

```ts
import { macAddress } from '@regle/rules';

const { r$ } = useRegle({address: ''}, {
  address: {
    macAddress: macAddress()
  }
})
```

This also applies to custom rules and it was not convenient.

With this update, when the option of a rule is optional, the rule can be used without calling it.

```ts
import { macAddress } from '@regle/rules';

const { r$ } = useRegle({address: ''}, {
  address: {
    // Can now be written inline
    macAddress,
    // But can still can be called with arguments
    macAddress: macAddress('::')
  }
})
```



## üëØ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Possibility to extend already created useRegle from defineRegleConfig with `extendRegleConfig`


If you have a shared custom `useRegle`, you may want to add even more rules or shortcuts to it. This was not possible with `defineRegleConfig`.

`@regle/core` now exports a new helper called `extendRegleConfig`.

```ts
import { extendRegleConfig } from '@regle/core';

const { useRegle: useExtendedRegle } = extendRegleConfig(useCustomRegle, {
  rules: () => ({
    customRuleExtended: withMessage(required, 'Custom rule 2'),
  })
})
```

Check out the [docs here](/advanced-usage/global-config#extend-global-config)


## üî£ allowSymbol option in `alphaNum` and `alpha` rules

Allowing rules with optional parameters to be used without function call was motivated by the fact that I had to add options to `alpha` and `alphaNum`, but would require a breaking changes in declaration.

Both rules have now optionals options, including `allowSymbols`.


```ts
import { alpha, alphaNum } from '@regle/rules';

const { r$ } = useRegle({ name: '' }, {
  name: { 
    alpha: alpha({ allowSymbols: true }),
    alphaNum: alphaNum({ allowSymbols: true }),
})

```

## üë¥ Dropped CommonJS support

Regle supported ESM & CJS builds, but after reading [Antfu's article on shipping ESM only](https://antfu.me/posts/move-on-to-esm-only), I decided to remove CJS support.
