# Introduction

## What is Regle?

If you've ever built a forms and wrote repetitive validation logic, struggling with complex error states, or losing type safety along the way, Regle is the perfect solution.

Regle is a type-safe, headless form validation library that lets you write validation rules that mirror your data structure. Think of it as the perfect evolution of Vuelidate, but with modern TypeScript support and a more intuitive API.



## Why Choose Regle?

- **ðŸ”’ Type Safe**: Full TypeScript inference means autocomplete everywhere and catch errors at compile time
- **ðŸŒ³ Model-Based**: Your validation tree matches your data modelâ€”no mental gymnastics required  
- **ðŸ”Œ Headless**: Works with any UI framework, CSS library, or design system
- **ðŸ“¦ Modular**: Use built-in rules or create custom ones that fit your exact needs
- **âš¡ Performance**: Efficient reactivity system that only updates what changed
- **ðŸ›  Developer Experience**: If you've used Vuelidate, you'll feel right at home



## Basic example

Here's a real form that you can copy and use right away:

<!-- @include: @/parts/QuickUsage.md -->

From `r$`, you can build any UI you want. The validation logic is completely separate from your presentation layer.

**Live Result:**

<QuickUsage/>

:::tip Coming from Vuelidate?
Regle's API is intentionally similar to Vuelidate's. Check out our [comparison guide](/introduction/comparisons#vuelidate) to see what's changed and what's stayed the same.
